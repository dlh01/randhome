# Randhome, the random home page #

Do you set your home page to your favorite news website so you can
inform yourself with just one click?

Are you frustrated knowing that your home page takes you to the same
site each time, with the same perspective, even though there are so
many different takes on the news you could get?

Or maybe you try to visit all of those sites at once and get flattened
by all the information you see as a result.

Randhome, the random home page, might ease your woes. At least, it
helped with mine.

It's a single HTML page. Add your favorite websites to the JavaScript
inside the file and set it as your home page. Each time you open your
home page, you'll be randomly flown to one of the sites in your list.
Over time, you should receive a balanced diet of the news. You'll know
that even though you usually don't have time to visit each site at
once, over time you'll get regular reports from all of them.


## Instructions ##

1. Open `home-page.html` in your favorite text editor.

2. Inside the `pages` var, add the URLs of your choice. Be sure to
enclose each URL inside single quotes. Add a comma after the closing
single quote next to each URL (except the last URL). Some sample URLs
and how they should be formatted are provided.

3. Set `home-page.html` to be your browser's home page.

   - If you use Dropbox, you can place `home-page.html` inside your
     Public folder, then copy the public URL that Dropbox creates
     (on a Mac or Ubuntu Linux, right-click on the file, go to the
     Dropbox menu, and then click "Copy Public Link." As an added
     bonus, this URL works from any machine.

   - If you don't use Dropbox, you'll have to set the browser's
     home page to the file path of `home-page.html`. On a Mac,
     you'll use something like
     `file:///Users/[yourusername]/Documents/randhome/home-page.html`.
     On Ubuntu Linux, the path will resemble
     `file:///home/[yourusername]/Documents/randhome/home-page.html`.
     I don't know what the path would be on Windows or in other
     Linux flavors.
